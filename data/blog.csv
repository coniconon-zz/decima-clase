But a gender pay gap soon appears, and it grows significantly over the next two decades.</p><p>So what changes? The answer can be found by looking at when the pay gap widens most sharply. It’s the late 20s to mid-30s, according to two new studies — in other words, when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do.</p><p>The big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women’s pay relative to men’s is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That’s especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.</p><p>But even married women without children earn less, research shows, because women are more likely to give up job opportunities to either move or stay put for their husband’s job. Married women might also take less intensive jobs in preparation for children, or employers might not give them more responsibility because they assume they’ll have babies and take time off.</p><p>“One person focuses on career, and the other one does the lion’s share of the work at home,” said Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College and an author of both papers. One will be published in the American Economic Review this month; the other was published this month as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The other researchers were Claudia Goldin of Harvard, Claudia Olivetti of Boston College and Erling Barth of the Institute for Social Research in Oslo.</p><p>It is logical for couples to decide that the person who earns less, usually a woman, does more of the household chores and child care, Ms. Kerr said. But it’s also a reason women earn less in the first place. “That reinforces the pay gap in the labor market, and we’re trapped in this self-reinforcing cycle,” she said.</p><p>Some women work less once they have children, but many don’t, and employers pay them less, too, seemingly because they assume they will be less committed, research shows.</p><p>Even when mothers cut back at work, they are not paid proportionately less. When their pay is calculated on an hourly basis, they are still paid less than men for the hours they work, Ms. Goldin has shown in previous work. Employers, especially for jobs that require a college degree, pay people disproportionately more for working long hours and disproportionately less for working flexibly.</p><p>To achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.</p><p>According to the data, Ms. Kerr said, college-educated women make about 90 percent as much as men at age 25 and about 55 percent as much at age 45.</p><p>The new working paper, which covered the broadest group of people over time, found that between ages 25 and 45, the gender pay gap for college graduates, which starts close to zero, widens by 55 percentage points. For those without college degrees, it widens by 28 percentage points.</p>","https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/15/business/17up-paygap-illo/00up-paygap-illo-master768.gif","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/upshot/the-gender-pay-gap-is-largely-because-of-motherhood.html"
"Closing The Gender Gap In Computer Science Begins In Kindergarten","It's no secret that women are underrepresented in the tech industry, making up about one-quarter of the workforce.","<p>It’s no secret that women are underrepresented in the tech industry, making up about one-quarter of the workforce. And women are less likely to pursue advanced high school coursework or college majors that lead to careers in the high-paying, high-demand tech sector. As a result, policymakers and pundits often focus their attention on the most obvious pain points; developing high school programs and pathway programs designed to drum up interest in STEM subjects that graduates can pursue in college.</p><p>But high school is much too late. By then, teenagers have solidified their interests; others have made up their minds about social norms and where men and women fall in the continuum of the workforce. New research shows girls as young as 6 are less likely than boys of the same age to view their gender as “really, really smart” and subsequently, begin to avoid activities deemed appropriate for “really, really smart” kids.</p><p>But if those gendered social norms are squashed, if interest can be piqued early on, and if that interest is nurtured through the teenage years, we can bend the curve on the tech talent pipeline to increase the number of girls who become women in tech. Here’s how.</p><p>Children are innately curious. Give a 5-year-old a mission or a challenge, and they set to work figuring it out. “Never give up,” says 7-year-old Camille Mascarenas of suburban Atlanta. “Be creative, be flexible.” Children exhibit the inquisitiveness inherently required in learning computer science or how to code; it’s up to us adults to harness that curiosity and apply it to something tangible that engages young minds.</p><p>Camille is one half of a two-person robotics team, the Robot Ninja Helpers. The other half is fellow first-grader Drew Williams. They started playing with a robot named Dash two years ago. First, they taught it how to move around, use its sensors, and activate its lights and sounds. Then, the two friends got serious. This year, they entered a robotics competition as one of 5,300 teams internationally—which required them to write code that would help Dash rescue an animal habitat on imaginary Bear Byte Island.</p><p>The assignment is strategic. It’s not coding for coding’s sake; it’s coding to solve a problem, to develop design skills, to document efforts in a science journal. Research shows that girls, in particular, are sparked by social issues, so Wonder League Robotics Competitions are based around solving social challenges.</p><p>The Robot Ninja Helpers went to work. They shot a video about their work; they sketched out design possibilities; they chronicled their efforts (including failures) on a blog. In their age group, behind a team from India, they placed second.</p><p>Camille and Drew told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that they’re already psyched for next year. That enthusiasm is why Wonder Workshop came to create Dash and his fellow robot, Dot. As an engineer and father of young girls, I experienced and saw the gender gaps both in access to science opportunities in school and in the representation of women among my colleagues in the workplace. But it wasn’t for lack of interest. As we did surveys and talked with parents, we learned that so many parents want their children to learn to code, but opportunities have been scant. And when opportunities have existed, they often weren’t delivered in an age-appropriate mechanism for engaging children under the age of 12.</p>","https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/633224957/960x0.jpg?fit=scale","https://www.forbes.com/sites/schoolboard/2017/05/05/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science-begins-in-kindergarten/#50528167a451"
